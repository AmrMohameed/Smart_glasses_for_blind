-  ## What's the project? and how it work?

    In our proposed system, camera network is built by placing a
camera at the blind's glasses.
    The cameras provide scene around faces of people, and inform blind users who is on the front of him.
In this process, matching-based face recognition is performed to find out the faces in the dataset (CSV file).
